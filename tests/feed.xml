      <title>Starlink: Battle for Atlas free from Ubisoft Connect</title>
      <description>Day two of Ubisoft's week of holiday giveaways is actually a full game.  You have 24 hours to claim your copy of Starlink: Battle for Atlas on Ubisoft Connect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bb_link&quot; href=&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://register.ubisoft.com/happyholidays2020-day2/en-US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; &gt;https://register.ubisoft.com/happyholidays2020-day2/en-US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;(or claim through the Uplay client)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Details:&lt;br&gt;- Account/DRM required: Ubisoft Connect (NOT Steam)&lt;br&gt;- Offer good through December 16, 1300 GMT&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a class=&quot;bb_link&quot; href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/950050/Starlink_Battle_for_Atlas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; &gt;Steam Store Page&lt;/a&gt; for evaluation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not immediately clear which version of the game this is.  Details will be added as they are discovered.  It also appears that these really are one day only offers (you can't still claim yesterday's AC:V DLC) so don't wait around to grab them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CyMonk was awake and linked in when this one went live.  Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LH&lt;br&gt;As far as I'm concerned, Star Link is the captain of the Swinetrek.</description>
